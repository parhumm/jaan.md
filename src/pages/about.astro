	<p>
		I'm Parhum Khoshbakht, Chief Product Officer at SabaIdea — the company behind
		<a href="https://www.aparat.com" target="_blank">Aparat</a> and
		<a href="https://www.filimo.com" target="_blank">Filimo</a>, Iran's leading video and streaming
		platforms. Since 2015 I've been leading multi-platform product teams across web, mobile, and
		connected TV, working at the intersection of user research, data, and shipping things that actually
		matter. I'm currently based in Germany.
	</p>

	<p>
		My product philosophy is simple: <em>"Find the next important job to be done, and with enough
		quality, ship it."</em> I lean heavily on qualitative research and direct user conversations to
		figure out what that job is. On the builder side, I created
		<strong>jaan-to</strong> — an AI-powered plugin for Claude Code with 18 skills covering product
		management, UX research, QA, and full-stack development workflows. To prove it works, I built
		<strong>Jaanify</strong> — a transparent AI task manager for neurodivergent users and
		freelancers — entirely using jaan-to itself, from PRD to deployment.
	</p>

	<p>
		I write in both English and Persian. On <a href="https://medium.com/@parhum" target="_blank">Medium</a>
		I cover product thinking, AI tooling, and building in public. On
		<a href="https://virgool.io/@parhum" target="_blank">Virgool</a> I write about self-knowledge,
		psychology, and the inner side of making things. Outside of product work, I'm drawn to street
		photography and poetry — both ways of paying close attention to what's already there.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm also an inside-out life coach. I work with people on understanding how their minds work — not
		to fix anything, but to see clearly. If you want to connect, you can find me on
		<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parhum/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> or at
		<a href="https://parhu.me" target="_blank">parhu.me</a>.
